<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a undergrauate student at Renmin University of China. And currently, I'am also a visiting student at UW-Madison. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Chaowei Xiao](https://xiaocw11.github.io/). Previously, I was supervised by Prof. [Keman Huang](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/staff/directory/keman-huang) in Remin Uinversity of China.

My research interest includes Large Language Model(LLM) Agent, Multi-Agent System and Code/Tool LLM. I believe build tool-enabled agent system is the way to benefit human by using LLMs.
